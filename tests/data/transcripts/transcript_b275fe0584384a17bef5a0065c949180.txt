<Person1> "Welcome to PODCASTFY  - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast. <emphasis>Tharsis Souza</emphasis>, what a name!  He's making waves in the tech world, and for good reason. This guy's got a PhD in Computer Science!  From UCL, no less!  That's, uh, University College London for all you non-academics out there." </Person1> 

<Person2> "Okay, impressive credentials, I'll grant you that. But what's got you so  <emphasis>hyped</emphasis> about this Tharsis guy? What's he actually done?" </Person2>

<Person1> "Hold your horses!  I'm getting to that. So,  Tharsis is deep into data-driven products. I mean, he <emphasis>lives and breathes</emphasis> this stuff.  He's currently the Senior VP of Product Management and Modeling Engineering at <emphasis>Two Sigma Investments</emphasis>.  You know,  one of those Wall Street giants using AI to, you know, make big financial decisions." </Person1>

<Person2> "Two Sigma, huh?  Alright, now you're talking. They're kind of a big deal in the finance world.  But what about this teaching gig at Columbia?  Is he, like, some kind of tech-whiz professor too?" </Person2>

<Person1> "Oh yeah! Totally forgot about that.  He's a lecturer at Columbia University, teaching in their fancy-pants Master of Science in Applied Analytics program. Apparently, he loves mentoring under-represented students and working professionals. You know, giving back and all that." </Person1>

<Person2> "Interesting. So, he's got the brains, the experience, and the heart.  Seems like the total package. But you mentioned something about him giving talks? What kind of things does he speak about? "</Person2> 

<Person1> "Oh, man,  <emphasis>all sorts</emphasis> of stuff! He's been featured in a Mentorship Spotlight, was on an  <emphasis>Innovative Data Panel</emphasis> at the FactSet Investment Process Symposium, and even did an interview with BattleFin Alternative Data. Oh! And I almost forgot,  he was  <emphasis>just on</emphasis>  Beryl Elites, talking about the disruptors in investment management. This guy gets around!" </Person1>

<Person2> "Wow, he sounds like he's really making a name for himself.  It's always great to see someone so passionate about their work, especially in a field as complex and rapidly evolving as AI and data science. "</Person2>

<Person1>  "Absolutely! Tharsis Souza, remember that name, folks. He's definitely one to watch.  And that's it for today’s episode of PODCASTFY.  Until next time, keep exploring the exciting world of AI and generative technology. This is Person1,  signing off!" </Person1>
